## lecture 1 - Why El Salvador needs Bitcoin

The first lecture ‘Why El Salvador needs Bitcoin’ provides an overview of: the Bitcoin protocol and its roots, the cypherpunk movement, and the importance of Bitcoin as a tool of freedom (uncensored money, financial inclusion, and other related topics).

Additionally, we will also share some additional resources to delve deeper into the covered topics. Enjoy! :

## Lecture 2 - Cypherpunk movement and Austrian Economics

In our second lecture 'Cypherpunk movement and Austrian Economics', we delved deeper into the Cypherpunk philosophy introduced by Rikki in the previous lecture.
Also, our discussion centered on the Austrian School of Economics, which distinguishes itself from the current financial system (Keynesian Economics).
We explored concepts such as scarcity, time preference, durability and saving, which Saifedean will delve into further. To prepare for his lecture, I recommend reading The Bitcoin Standard (you can find it in 'Additional Resources'), or at least a few chapters.
It is important to note that the first module, 'Why Bitcoin', was necessary to comprehend the roots and goals before moving on to 'How Bitcoin', where we will discover the Bitcoin's technological stack and tradeoffs early developers made in the protocol.
